# REP
My REP project
For this semesters reverse engineering project I chose a Samsung TV remote. This is my second semester of CAD modeling and I find it challenging, but also fun once you get the hang of things. I found the battery springs the most challenging and with help from my professor I was able to get the feel of it. The button insert/front was the second most challenging. The dimensioning was not hard, but just about every row of buttons were different sizes. So I had to manually dimension each button row and then when it came to the assembly process, getting them matched up was frustrating at times. I chose this object because it is used by just about everyone everyday. When you do not think about things you use everyday, you may take things for granite. Now that I am an engineering student I think about things differently and how things are made and created. I look forward to continuing my studies and seeking a career out of it.
